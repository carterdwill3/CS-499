# **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This project started as a milestone assignment I finished last year in my CS-320 course. I made a simple contact management system in Java. The original solution
had a Contact class with methods for validation, a ContactService class that uses a hash map for in-memory storage to maintain contacts, and test classes
(ContactTest and ContactServiceTest) to make sure everything works and handles the errors. This project shows some basic software engineering design and input
validation techniques.

**_ENHANCEMENT ONE CONCEPT_**

My enhancement plan transforms the basic contact service into a REST API with database persistence. This involves replacing the hash map with database storage,
implementing a repository pattern for data access, and creating REST endpoints for contact operations.
_This enhancement demonstrates the best methods of architecture while maintaining important core functionality._

-
**_ENHANCEMENT TWO CONCEPT_**

My algorithms and data structure-like enhancement plan will also transform the basic contact storage into a higher-level data management system with multiple
advanced data structures and efficient algorithms.
_This includes: implementing custom search algorithms, sorting mechanisms, and optimized data structures; this will give various contact management operations
that improve the codeâ€™s performance._

-
**_ENHANCEMENT THREE CONCEPT_**

My database enhancement plan turns the in-memory contact storage into a comprehensive database solution with MySQL integration, advanced querying capabilities,
and data analytics features.
_This includes: implementing relational database design with multiple related tables, creating stored procedures for complex operations, and adding data mining
capabilities for contact insights._
