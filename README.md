### My Journey Through Computer Science

Completing the Computer Science program at SNHU has been one of those experiences that really changes how you think about problem-solving and technology. When I started nearly three years ago as a transfer student, I had some programming experience, but I didn't fully grasp how all the pieces of software development fit together. Now, looking back at my work and putting together this ePortfolio, I can see how much I've grown both technically and professionally.

The biggest lesson I learned? Structure matters—a lot. Early on, I'd write code that worked but was messy and hard to maintain. I learned the hard way that small errors in how you organize your code will have you questioning your sanity when trying to debug later. Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces became second nature, and it's a skill that applies far beyond just coding.

### What I've Learned and How I Apply It

**Building Better Software**  
Working on my contact management enhancement really opened my eyes to what good software architecture looks like. Taking a basic Java application and transforming it into a full REST API with database integration taught me about separation of concerns, proper error handling, and security considerations. It's one thing to make code work; it's another to make it maintainable and secure.

**Thinking Algorithmically**  
I'll be honest, algorithms and data structures used to intimidate me. But working through performance optimizations for my contact system changed that perspective. Replacing simple linear searches with binary search trees and implementing efficient sorting algorithms showed me how the right data structure can make a huge difference in performance.

**Database Design and Security**  
Database work turned out to be more interesting than I expected. Moving from simple hash maps to a properly normalized MySQL database with foreign key relationships taught me to think about data integrity and consistency. Implementing prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks made security feel less abstract and more like a practical necessity.

### Real-World Application

My day job as a controls specialist gives me a unique perspective on how software development connects to physical systems. Working with PLCs and HMIs has taught me that good code isn't just about elegant algorithms—it's about reliability, maintainability, and clear communication with team members who might not have the same technical background.

This experience has shaped my career goals around automation and system integration. I want to work in spaces where traditional manufacturing meets modern software development, particularly in Industry 4.0 applications where data analytics can optimize production processes.

### What This Portfolio Demonstrates

The three enhancements I've included here tell a story about how I approach software development:

- **Software Design**: Shows I can think architecturally and build systems that are maintainable and secure
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Demonstrates my ability to optimize performance and choose appropriate solutions
- **Database Integration**: Proves I can handle data management, security, and complex querying

Each enhancement builds on the others, which mirrors how real projects work—you're rarely just doing "front-end" or "back-end" work in isolation.

### Looking Forward

I feel ready to contribute meaningfully to development teams, particularly in roles that combine my industrial automation background with software development skills. The program taught me not just how to code, but how to think about systems, security, and user needs.

This portfolio represents where I am today, but it's really just the starting point for what I hope will be a long and interesting career in computer science.

## 🚀 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project started as a milestone assignment I finished last year in my **CS-320 course**. I made a simple contact management system in Java. The original solution had a Contact class with methods for validation, a ContactService class that uses a hash map for in-memory storage to maintain contacts, and test classes (ContactTest and ContactServiceTest) to make sure everything works and handles the errors. 

> 💡 **This project shows some basic software engineering design and input validation techniques.**
