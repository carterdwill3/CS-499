This project started as a milestone assignment I finished last year in my CS-320 course. I made a simple contact management system in Java. The original solution had a Contact class with methods for validation,
a ContactService class that uses a hash map for in-memory storage to maintain contacts, and test classes (ContactTest and ContactServiceTest) to make sure everything works and handles the errors.
This project shows some basic software engineering design and input validation techniques.

*ENHANCEMENT 1*
My enhancement plan transforms the basic contact service into a REST API with database persistence. This involves replacing the hash map with database storage, implementing a repository pattern for data access,
and creating REST endpoints for contact operations. This enhancement demonstrates best methods of architecture while maintaining important core functionality.

*ENHANCEMENT 2*
My algorithms and data structure-like enhancement plan will also transform the basic contact storage into a higher-level data management system with multiple advanced data structures
and efficient algorithms. This includes: implementing custom search algorithms, sorting mechanisms, and optimized data structures; this will give various contact management operations that improve
the codeâ€™s performance.

*ENHANCEMENT 3*
My database enhancement plan turns the in-memory contact storage into a comprehensive database solution with MySQL integration, advanced querying capabilities, and data analytics features.
This includes: implementing relational database design with multiple related tables, creating stored procedures for complex operations, and adding data mining capabilities for contact insights.
