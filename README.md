## 🚀 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project started as a milestone assignment I finished last year in my **CS-320 course**. I made a simple contact management system in Java. The original solution had a Contact class with methods for validation, a ContactService class that uses a hash map for in-memory storage to maintain contacts, and test classes (ContactTest and ContactServiceTest) to make sure everything works and handles the errors. 

> 💡 **This project shows some basic software engineering design and input validation techniques.**

## 🛠️ ENHANCEMENT CONCEPTS

### 🔧 **ENHANCEMENT ONE CONCEPT**

My enhancement plan transforms the basic contact service into a **REST API with database persistence**. This involves:

- ⚡ Replacing the hash map with database storage
- 🏗️ Implementing a repository pattern for data access  
- 🌐 Creating REST endpoints for contact operations

> *This enhancement demonstrates the best methods of architecture while maintaining important core functionality.*

My algorithms and data structure-like enhancement plan will also transform the basic contact storage into a **higher-level data management system** with multiple advanced data structures and efficient algorithms. 

**Key Features:**
- 🔍 Implementing custom search algorithms
- 📊 Sorting mechanisms  
- ⚡ Optimized data structures
- 📈 Various contact management operations that improve the code's performance

> *This includes: implementing custom search algorithms, sorting mechanisms, and optimized data structures; this will give various contact management operations that improve the code's performance.*

My database enhancement plan turns the in-memory contact storage into a **comprehensive database solution** with MySQL integration, advanced querying capabilities, and data analytics features.

**Implementation Includes:**
- 🗃️ Implementing relational database design with multiple related tables
- ⚙️ Creating stored procedures for complex operations
- 📊 Adding data mining capabilities for contact insights
