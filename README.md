## üöÄ PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project started as a milestone assignment I finished last year in my **CS-320 course**. I made a simple contact management system in Java. The original solution had a Contact class with methods for validation, a ContactService class that uses a hash map for in-memory storage to maintain contacts, and test classes (ContactTest and ContactServiceTest) to make sure everything works and handles the errors. 

> üí° **This project shows some basic software engineering design and input validation techniques.**

## üõ†Ô∏è ENHANCEMENT CONCEPTS

### üîß **ENHANCEMENT ONE CONCEPT**
[![Software Design](https://img.shields.io/badge/ENHANCEMENT-SOFTWARE%20DESIGN%20%26%20ENGINEERING-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=code)](https://github.com/carterdwill3/CS-499/tree/EnhancementOne)

My enhancement plan transforms the basic contact service into a **REST API with database persistence**. This involves:

- ‚ö° Replacing the hash map with database storage
- üèóÔ∏è Implementing a repository pattern for data access  
- üåê Creating REST endpoints for contact operations

> *This enhancement demonstrates the best methods of architecture while maintaining important core functionality.*

### ‚öôÔ∏è **ENHANCEMENT TWO CONCEPT**

My algorithms and data structure-like enhancement plan will also transform the basic contact storage into a **higher-level data management system** with multiple advanced data structures and efficient algorithms. 

**Key Features:**
- üîç Implementing custom search algorithms
- üìä Sorting mechanisms  
- ‚ö° Optimized data structures
- üìà Various contact management operations that improve the code's performance

> *This includes: implementing custom search algorithms, sorting mechanisms, and optimized data structures; this will give various contact management operations that improve the code's performance.*

### üóÑÔ∏è **ENHANCEMENT THREE CONCEPT**
[![Database](https://img.shields.io/badge/ENHANCEMENT-DATABASE%20DESIGN-purple?style=for-the-badge&logo=database)](https://github.com/carterdwill3/CS-499/tree/EnhancementThree)

My database enhancement plan turns the in-memory contact storage into a **comprehensive database solution** with MySQL integration, advanced querying capabilities, and data analytics features.

**Implementation Includes:**
- üóÉÔ∏è Implementing relational database design with multiple related tables
- ‚öôÔ∏è Creating stored procedures for complex operations
- üìä Adding data mining capabilities for contact insights

> *This includes: implementing relational database design with multiple related tables, creating stored procedures for complex operations, and adding data mining capabilities for contact insights.*
